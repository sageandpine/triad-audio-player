# Triad audio player

## Summary
With **Triad**, I want to create a simple and useful audio player in Python that is capable of playing my music collection. This seems like a great way to wrap my love of art, code and music into a project I can continue to build out once the core functions have been established. Ideally all audio formats should play, but the main trio is the focus: MP3, WAV, FLAC (Hence: TRIAD audio).

## Beta Testing Notes:
* Be sure to install pygame & tinytag if running locally
   - python3 -m pip install -U pygame --user
   - pip install tinytag 
* ~~When using the OPEN button you are choosing a directory. Click all the way into the directory/album where the mp3 files are. You won't see the mp3 files. That's normal and you can open it from here. The files will auto-populate. May switch to multi-file selction later.~~
