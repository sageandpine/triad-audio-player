# Triad audio player

With Triad, I want to create a simple and useful audio player in Python that is capable of playing my music collection. This seems like a great way to wrap my love of art, code and music into a project I can continue to build out once the core functions have been established. All audio formats should play, but the main trio is: MP3, WAV, FLAC

## Basic Functions 

* Playback
* Skip forward
* Skip back
* Stop
* Display Folder contents
* Display Album Art if available
* Display player logo when not available
* Create and Save playlists

## Advanced Functions

* Visualizer for music
    * Eq Bars
    * Spirograph
    * Wav forms
    * Color Hues
* Themes/Skins
* Pop out mini player
* Package as executable for any system
* In file list use bpm to move through letters of playing song-make a letter switch to caps then back to lower.
