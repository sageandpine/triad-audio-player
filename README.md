# Triad audio player

### Beta Testing Note:
* When using the OPEN button you are choosing a directory. Click all the way into the directory/album where the mp3 files are. You won't see the mp3 files. That's normal and you can open it from here. The files will auto-populate. May switch to multi-file selction later.

With **Triad**, I want to create a simple and useful audio player in Python that is capable of playing my music collection. This seems like a great way to wrap my love of art, code and music into a project I can continue to build out once the core functions have been established. Ideally all audio formats should play, but the main trio is the focus: MP3, WAV, FLAC (Hence: TRIAD audio).

## Basic Functions 

* ~~PLAY~~
* ~~Skip forward FWD~~
* ~~Skip back/RWD~~
* ~~PAUSE~~
* ~~Display Folder contents~~
* ~~Click on files in list to play them~~
* Display Album Art if available
* ~~Display player logo when not available~~
* Create/Save/Edit playlists
* Shuffle
* Loop single/ Loop All
* Refine GUI

## Advanced Functions
* Accept FLAC/WAV
* Light/Dark Mode
* Visualizer for music
    * Eq Bars
    * Spirograph
    * Wav forms
    * Color Hues
* Themes/Skins
* Pop out mini player
* Package as executable for any system
* In file list use bpm to move through letters of playing song-make a letter switch to caps then back to lower.
